No references in C, only pointers used



1.Pointers

&nbsp;	-stack vs heap

&nbsp;	-parameters passing

2.Bits structures - alter memory at bit level

3.Memory classes - e.g.: static, auto, 

4.Union structure - Enum (?)



Pointer > memory > storage > collection of data

\*Most basic data structure is a pointer, afterwards arrays





Linear structures:

1.Dynamic data structures - linked + double linked lists

2.Stacks and queues

3.Hash Table = array of lists (map)

4.Heap - complete trees, array implementation

5.Collections Maps \& Sets



Non-Linear structures:

1.Binary Search trees

2.Binary Balanced vs Imbalanced Trees

3.B trees - firstly grow in width and afterwards grow in height

4.Graphs



\*The fastest data structure type must be chosen for each use case.



Applications (extra\*):

1.Compression

2.String processing

3.Sorting

4.conversions

5.Library functions





Tree starts from 1 seed = pointer in stack > from there data structure is created in heap





Characteristics:



Dynamic vs static space

memory layout - contiguous or scattered

algorithm complexity - Big-O

optimization - memory optimization / time optimization



Overhead memory - used for specific pointers not directly used, but needed to be declared



Big-O: 1-> log N -> N -> N log N -> N^2 -> N^C -> C^N
